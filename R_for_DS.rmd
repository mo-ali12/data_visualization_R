# Creating a ggplot

**Loading data**

```{r}
library(dplyr)
mpg_data <- ggplot2::mpg
```



```{r}
ggplot2::ggplot(data = mpg_data) + 
  ggplot2::geom_point(mapping = ggplot2::aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

```{r}
ggplot2::ggplot(data = mpg_data) + ggplot2::geom_point(mapping = ggplot2::aes(x =cyl, y= hwy))
```


**You can convey information about your data by mapping the aesthetics in your plot to the variables in your dataset. For example, you can map the colors of your points to the class variable to reveal the class of each car.**

```{r}
ggplot2::ggplot(data = mpg_data) + ggplot2::geom_point(mapping = ggplot2::aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class))
```

**In the above example, we mapped class to the color aesthetic, but we could have mapped class to the size aesthetic in the same way. In this case, the exact size of each point would reveal its class affiliation. We get a warning here, because mapping an unordered variable (class) to an ordered aesthetic (size) is not a good idea.**

```{r}
ggplot2::ggplot(data = mpg_data) + ggplot2::geom_point(mapping = ggplot2::aes(x = displ, y = hwy, size = class))
```

**Or we could have mapped class to the alpha aesthetic, which controls the transparency of the points, or to the shape aesthetic, which controls the shape of the points.**

```{r}
ggplot2::ggplot(data = mpg_data) + ggplot2::geom_point(mapping = ggplot2::aes(x = displ, y = hwy, alpha = class))
ggplot2::ggplot(data = mpg_data) + ggplot2::geom_point(mapping = ggplot2::aes(x = displ, y = hwy, shape = class))

```


**Exercises 3.1.1**

```{r}
ggplot2::ggplot(data = mpg_data) + 
  ggplot2::geom_point(mapping = ggplot2::aes(x = trans, y = model, shape = class) )
```


## 2. Facets

**To facet your plot by a single variable, use facet_wrap(). The first argument of facet_wrap() should be a formula, which you create with ~ followed by a variable name (here “formula” is the name of a data structure in R, not a synonym for “equation”). The variable that you pass to facet_wrap() should be discrete.**

```{r}
ggplot2::ggplot(data = mpg_data) +
  ggplot2::geom_point(mapping = ggplot2::aes(x =displ, y = hwy)) +
  ggplot2::facet_wrap(~ class, nrow = 2)
```

**To facet your plot on the combination of two variables, add facet_grid() to your plot call. The first argument of facet_grid() is also a formula. This time the formula should contain two variable names separated by a**

```{r}
ggplot2::ggplot(data = mpg_data) +
  ggplot2::geom_point(mapping = ggplot2::aes(x =displ, y = hwy)) +
  ggplot2::facet_grid(model ~ cyl)
```

**If you prefer to not facet in the rows or columns dimension, use a . instead of a variable name, e.g. + facet_grid(. ~ cyl).**

```{r}
ggplot2::ggplot(data = mpg_data) +
  ggplot2::geom_point(mapping = ggplot2::aes(x =displ, y = hwy)) +
  ggplot2::facet_grid(. ~ cyl)
```
```{r}
ggplot2::ggplot(mpg_data, ggplot2::aes(x=class, y=drv)) + ggplot2::geom_point()

````

## EXercise 1

**What do the empty cells in plot with facet_grid(drv ~ cyl) mean? How do they relate to this plot?**

```{r}
ggplot2::ggplot(data = mpg_data) + 
  ggplot2::geom_point(mapping = ggplot2::aes(x = drv, y = cyl))
```

**What plots does the following code make? What does . do?**

```{r}
ggplot2::ggplot(data = mpg_data) + 
 ggplot2::geom_point(mapping = ggplot2::aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  ggplot2::facet_grid(drv ~ .)

ggplot2::ggplot(data = mpg_data) + 
  ggplot2::geom_point(mapping = ggplot2::aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  ggplot2::facet_grid(. ~ cyl)
```

# 3. Geometric objects

**A geom is the geometrical object that a plot uses to represent data. People often describe plots by the type of geom that the plot uses. For example, bar charts use bar geoms, line charts use line geoms, boxplots use boxplot geoms, and so on. Scatterplots break the trend; they use the point geom. As we see above, you can use different geoms to plot the same data. The plot on the left uses the point geom, and the plot on the right uses the smooth geom, a smooth line fitted to the data.**

**To change the geom in your plot, change the geom function that you add to ggplot(). For instance, to make the plots above, you can use this code:**

```{r}
ggplot2::ggplot(data = mpg_data) +
  ggplot2::geom_smooth(mapping = ggplot2::aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

**Every geom function in ggplot2 takes a mapping argument. However, not every aesthetic works with every geom. You could set the shape of a point, but you couldn’t set the “shape” of a line. On the other hand, you could set the linetype of a line. geom_smooth() will draw a different line, with a different linetype, for each unique value of the variable that you map to linetype.**

```{r}
ggplot2::ggplot(data =mpg_data) +
  ggplot2::geom_smooth(mapping = ggplot2::aes(x = displ, y = hwy, linetype = drv))
```

**Many geoms, like geom_smooth(), use a single geometric object to display multiple rows of data. For these geoms, you can set the group aesthetic to a categorical variable to draw multiple objects. ggplot2 will draw a separate object for each unique value of the grouping variable. In practice, ggplot2 will automatically group the data for these geoms whenever you map an aesthetic to a discrete variable (as in the linetype example). It is convenient to rely on this feature because the group aesthetic by itself does not add a legend or distinguishing features to the geoms.**

```{r}
ggplot2::ggplot(data = mpg_data) +
  ggplot2::geom_smooth(mapping = ggplot2::aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

ggplot2::ggplot(data = mpg_data) +
  ggplot2::geom_smooth(mapping = ggplot2::aes(x = displ, y = hwy, group = drv))

ggplot2::ggplot(data = mpg_data) +
  ggplot2::geom_smooth(mapping = ggplot2::aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv))

```

**To display multiple geoms in the same plot, add multiple geom functions to ggplot():**


```{r}
ggplot2::ggplot(data = mpg_data) +
  ggplot2::geom_point(mapping = ggplot2::aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  ggplot2::geom_smooth(mapping = ggplot2::aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

```

**This, however, introduces some duplication in our code. Imagine if you wanted to change the y-axis to display cty instead of hwy. You’d need to change the variable in two places, and you might forget to update one. You can avoid this type of repetition by**

```{r}
ggplot2::ggplot(data = mpg_data, mapping = ggplot2::aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  ggplot2::geom_point() + 
  ggplot2::geom_smooth()
```

**If you place mappings in a geom function, ggplot2 will treat them as local mappings for the layer. It will use these mappings to extend or overwrite the global mappings for that layer only. This makes it possible to display different aesthetics in different layers**

```{r}
ggplot2::ggplot(data = mpg_data, mapping = ggplot2::aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  ggplot2::geom_point(mapping = ggplot2::aes(color = class)) + 
  ggplot2::geom_smooth()

```

**You can use the same idea to specify different data for each layer. Here, our smooth line displays just a subset of the mpg dataset, the subcompact cars. The local data argument in geom_smooth() overrides the global data argument in ggplot() for that layer only.**

```{r}
ggplot2::ggplot(data = mpg_data, mapping = ggplot2::aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  ggplot2::geom_point(mapping = ggplot2::aes(color = class)) + 
  ggplot2::geom_smooth(data = filter(mpg_data, class == "subcompact"), se = FALSE)
```

## Exercise 3.6.1

```{r}
ggplot2::ggplot(data = mpg_data, mapping = ggplot2::aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) + 
  ggplot2::geom_point() + 
  ggplot2::geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
```

```{r}
ggplot2::ggplot(data = mpg_data) +
  ggplot2::geom_point(mapping = ggplot2::aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

ggplot2::ggplot(data = mpg_data,mapping = ggplot2::aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  ggplot2::geom_point() +
  ggplot2::geom_smooth(se = FALSE)  #SE is for translucent background showing the confidence interval.

ggplot2::ggplot(data = mpg_data,mapping = ggplot2::aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  ggplot2::geom_point(mapping = ggplot2::aes(color = drv)) +
  ggplot2::geom_smooth(mapping = ggplot2::aes(color = drv),se = FALSE)

ggplot2::ggplot(data = mpg_data,mapping = ggplot2::aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  ggplot2::geom_point(mapping = ggplot2::aes(color = drv)) +
  ggplot2::geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
  

ggplot2::ggplot(data = mpg_data,mapping = ggplot2::aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  ggplot2::geom_point(mapping = ggplot2::aes(color = drv)) +
  ggplot2::geom_smooth(mapping = ggplot2::aes(linetype = drv),se = FALSE)

ggplot2::ggplot(data = mpg_data,mapping = ggplot2::aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  ggplot2::geom_point(size = 4, colour = "white") + 
  ggplot2::geom_point(ggplot2::aes(colour = drv))
  

```

## 4. Statistical transformations

**Bar Charts**

```{r}
diamonds_data <-ggplot2::diamonds
ggplot2::ggplot(data = diamonds_data) +
ggplot2::geom_bar(mapping = ggplot2::aes(x = cut))
```

**On the x-axis, the chart displays cut, a variable from diamonds. On the y-axis, it displays count, but count is not a variable in diamonds! Where does count come from? Many graphs, like scatterplots, plot the raw values of your dataset. Other graphs, like bar charts, calculate new values to plot:**

**bar charts, histograms, and frequency polygons bin your data and then plot bin counts, the number of points that fall in each bin.**

**smoothers fit a model to your data and then plot predictions from the model.**

**boxplots compute a robust summary of the distribution and then display a specially formatted box.**

**The algorithm used to calculate new values for a graph is called a stat, short for statistical transformation. The figure below describes how this process works with geom_bar().**


![Stat transformation](C:/Users/Mohsin Ali/Documents/R/visualization-stat-bar.png)

**You can learn which stat a geom uses by inspecting the default value for the stat argument. For example, ?geom_bar shows that the default value for stat is “count”, which means that geom_bar() uses stat_count(). stat_count() is documented on the same page as geom_bar(), and if you scroll down you can find a section called “Computed variables”. That describes how it computes two new variables: count and prop.**

**You can generally use geoms and stats interchangeably. For example, you can recreate the previous plot using stat_count() instead of geom_bar():**

```{r}
ggplot2::ggplot(data = diamonds_data) +
  ggplot2::stat_count(mapping = ggplot2::aes(x = cut))
```

**This works because every geom has a default stat; and every stat has a default geom. This means that you can typically use geoms without worrying about the underlying statistical transformation. There are three reasons you might need to use a stat explicitly:**

**1. You might want to override the default stat. In the code below, I change the stat of geom_bar() from count (the default) to identity. This lets me map the height of the bars to the raw values of a y variable. Unfortunately when people talk about bar charts casually, they might be referring to this type of bar chart, where the height of the bar is already present in the data, or the previous bar chart where the height of the bar is generated by counting rows.**

```{r}

demo <- tribble(
  ~cut,         ~freq,
  "Fair",       1610,
  "Good",       4906,
  "Very Good",  12082,
  "Premium",    13791,
  "Ideal",      21551
)

ggplot2::ggplot(data = demo) +
  ggplot2::geom_bar(mapping = ggplot2::aes(x = cut, y = freq), stat = "identity") #stat = "identity" in geom_bar(), you're telling ggplot2 to skip the aggregation and that you'll provide the y values. This mirrors the natural behavior of geom_col().

```

**2.You might want to override the default mapping from transformed variables to aesthetics. For example, you might want to display a bar chart of proportion, rather than count:**

```{r}
ggplot2::ggplot(data = diamonds_data) +
  ggplot2::geom_bar(mapping = ggplot2::aes(x = cut, y= stat(prop), group = 1))
```

**3. You might want to draw greater attention to the statistical transformation in your code. For example, you might use stat_summary(), which summarises the y values for each unique x value, to draw attention to the summary that you’re computing:**

```{r}
ggplot2::ggplot(data = diamonds_data) +
  ggplot2::stat_summary(mapping = ggplot2::aes(x = cut, y =depth), fun.ymin = min, fun.ymax = max, fun.y = median)

```

**End Note : ggplot2 provides over 20 stats for you to use. Each stat is a function, so you can get help in the usual way, e.g. ?stat_bin. To see a complete list of stats, try the ggplot2 cheatsheet.**

## 5. Position adjustments

**You can colour a bar chart using either the colour aesthetic, or, more usefully, fill:**
```{r}
ggplot2::ggplot(data = diamonds_data) +
  ggplot2::geom_bar(mapping = ggplot2::aes(x = cut, color = cut))
```

```{r}
ggplot2::ggplot(data = diamonds_data) +
  ggplot2::geom_bar(mapping = ggplot2::aes(x = cut, fill = cut))
```

**if you map the fill aesthetic to another variable, like clarity: the bars are automatically stacked. Each colored rectangle represents a combination of cut and clarity.**

```{r}
ggplot2::ggplot(data = diamonds_data) +
  ggplot2::geom_bar(mapping = ggplot2::aes(x = cut, fill = clarity))
```

**The stacking is performed automatically by the position adjustment specified by the position argument. If you don’t want a stacked bar chart, you can use one of three other options: "identity", "dodge" or "fill".**

**position = "identity" will place each object exactly where it falls in the context of the graph. This is not very useful for bars, because it overlaps them. To see that overlapping we either need to make the bars slightly transparent by setting alpha to a small value, or completely transparent by setting fill = NA.**

```{r}
ggplot2::ggplot(data = diamonds_data) +
  ggplot2::geom_bar(mapping = ggplot2::aes(x = cut, fill = clarity), alpha = 1/5, position = "identity" )
```

```{r}
ggplot2::ggplot(data = diamonds_data) +
  ggplot2::geom_bar(mapping = ggplot2::aes(x = cut, color = clarity), fill = NA, position = "identity" )
```

**position = "fill" works like stacking, but makes each set of stacked bars the same height. This makes it easier to compare proportions across groups.**

```{r}
ggplot2::ggplot(data = diamonds_data) +
  ggplot2::geom_bar(mapping = ggplot2::aes(x = cut, fill = clarity),position = "fill" )
```

**position = "dodge" places overlapping objects directly beside one another. This makes it easier to compare individual values.**

```{r}
ggplot2::ggplot(data = diamonds_data) +
  ggplot2::geom_bar(mapping = ggplot2::aes(x = cut, fill = clarity),position = "dodge" )
```

**There’s one other type of adjustment that’s not useful for bar charts, but it can be very useful for scatterplots. Recall our first scatterplot. Did you notice that the plot displays only 126 points, even though there are 234 observations in the dataset?**

```{r}
ggplot2::ggplot(data = mpg_data) +
  ggplot2::geom_point(mapping = ggplot2::aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

```

**The values of hwy and displ are rounded so the points appear on a grid and many points overlap each other. This problem is known as overplotting. This arrangement makes it hard to see where the mass of the data is. Are the data points spread equally throughout the graph, or is there one special combination of hwy and displ that contains 109 values?**

**You can avoid this gridding by setting the position adjustment to “jitter”. position = "jitter" adds a small amount of random noise to each point. This spreads the points out because no two points are likely to receive the same amount of random noise.**
```{r}
ggplot2::ggplot(data = mpg_data) +
  ggplot2::geom_point(mapping = ggplot2::aes(x = displ, y = hwy), position = "jitter")
```

**Adding randomness seems like a strange way to improve your plot, but while it makes your graph less accurate at small scales, it makes your graph more revealing at large scales. Because this is such a useful operation, ggplot2 comes with a shorthand for geom_point(position = "jitter"): geom_jitter().**

**To learn more about a position adjustment, look up the help page associated with each adjustment: ?position_dodge, ?position_fill, ?position_identity, ?position_jitter, and ?position_stack.**

**geom_jitter() to deal with overplotting**

```{r}
ggplot2::ggplot(data = mpg_data) +
  ggplot2::geom_jitter(mapping = ggplot2::aes(x = displ, y = hwy), width = 2, height = 2) #height and width to set the noise along x and y axis
```

## 6. Boxplots

```{r}
ggplot2::ggplot(data = mpg_data) +
  ggplot2::geom_boxplot(mapping = ggplot2::aes(x = class , y = hwy, fill = class), position = "dodge")
```

## 7. The layered grammar of graphics

**In the previous sections, you learned much more than how to make scatterplots, bar charts, and boxplots. You learned a foundation that you can use to make any type of plot with ggplot2. To see this, let’s add position adjustments, stats, coordinate systems, and faceting to our code template:**

**ggplot(data = <DATA>) + **
  **<GEOM_FUNCTION>(**
  **mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>),**
 **stat = <STAT>,** 
  **position = <POSITION>**
**) +**
  **<COORDINATE_FUNCTION> +**
  **<FACET_FUNCTION>**
  
  **Our new template takes seven parameters, the bracketed words that appear in the template. In practice, you rarely need to supply all seven parameters to make a graph because ggplot2 will provide useful defaults for everything except the data, the mappings, and the geom function.**

**The seven parameters in the template compose the grammar of graphics, a formal system for building plots. The grammar of graphics is based on the insight that you can uniquely describe any plot as a combination of a dataset, a geom, a set of mappings, a stat, a position adjustment, a coordinate system, and a faceting scheme.**

**To see how this works, consider how you could build a basic plot from scratch: you could start with a dataset and then transform it into the information that you want to display (with a stat).**

![Grammer](C:/Users/Mohsin Ali/Documents/R/visualization-grammar-1.png)

**Next, you could choose a geometric object to represent each observation in the transformed data. You could then use the aesthetic properties of the geoms to represent variables in the data. You would map the values of each variable to the levels of an aesthetic.**

![Grammer](C:/Users/Mohsin Ali/Documents/R/visualization-grammar-2.png)

**You’d then select a coordinate system to place the geoms into. You’d use the location of the objects (which is itself an aesthetic property) to display the values of the x and y variables. At that point, you would have a complete graph, but you could further adjust the positions of the geoms within the coordinate system (a position adjustment) or split the graph into subplots (faceting). You could also extend the plot by adding one or more additional layers, where each additional layer uses a dataset, a geom, a set of mappings, a stat, and a position adjustment.**

![Grammer](C:/Users/Mohsin Ali/Documents/R/visualization-grammar-3.png)

**You could use this method to build any plot that you imagine. In other words, you can use the code template that you’ve learned in this chapter to build hundreds of thousands of unique plots.**

                                           **END**
